Lab Guide Instructions: Setting Up a VPC with Public and Private Subnets using Terraform. 

1. Declare Data Source for Availability Zones
  - Use the aws_availability_zones data source to get the list of available availability zones in your region. This data source will be used to distribute subnets across   different zones.

2. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
   - Define the VPC with a specified CIDR block. The VPC will serve as the isolated network environment for your infrastructure.
